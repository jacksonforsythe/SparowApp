<h1 style="text-align:center">Our Project: FeelTrip</h1>

<h2 style="text-align:center">-What We're All About DUSSSSSSTTTTT !!!!!! -</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">My team and I are building a social app that is going to change the way you interact with your city and community. 
The app will help connect you with events catered to your interests and share your events with your friends - old and new!

<p style="text-align:center">Every new day is an opportunity to discover new experiences, yet far too often we miss out on reaching that potential. 
The problem is not that there is a lack of information, the problem is that there isn't a platform that effectively 
curates and displays the endless possibilities available within your city. The current platforms are static and 
artificial leading you to places you already know about or you don't want to be at. The suggestions are often outdated,
not to your personal preferences or they do not account for real changes that occur in our daily lives.</p> 

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Enter FeelTrip: a mobile application that is as dynamic as you are.</b></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">-Why Now?-</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">We've all experienced the dread of trying to answer, "Where are we going tonight?". 
If you're like us, you're tired of going to the same places with the same crowd, listening to the same music - every weekend is starting 
to seem like Groundhog Day. If you're like us, you want to experience the nights where you find yourself with amazing company, great music 
and of course plenty of drinks. These nights however, seem to come around once in a blue moon.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">-What's In It For You?-</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">Our app will make sure every one of your nights is done right by giving you info about:
<ol type="i">
  <li>What's happening around you</li>
  <li>Where's everyone is going</li>
  <li>Which parties are trending in real time</li>
</ol>
</p>
